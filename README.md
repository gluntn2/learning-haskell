# Learning Haskell Î»

I've always wanted to teach myself Haskell, so in this repo I've decided to collect all my
projects in Haskell I'm doing, just to see my own progress and hopefully having people
help me if I do something unspeakable.

Feel free to submit issues if you see any code that's not in the spirit of Haskell!
